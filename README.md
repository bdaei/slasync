ISMOT Async Helper

This is a wrapper library for Microsoft's Async Library (CTP). Using this library greatly facilitates async calls 
in Silverlight and Windows Phone projects.

Programming in Silverlight and Silverlight for Windows Phone requires a lot of asycronous calls to various services, 
which normally can be a painful task and results in a very complicated, spagetti-like, horrible code! 
By using this library writing async code is as easy as normal (sync) code. All you want to do is to call Invoke 
method and all the magic happens by itself!
